Format of the HOST_INFO_FILE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

HOST_INFO_FILE provides information about the host to connect to. It's
first line should begin with hostname (or with an asterisk if we would
wait for reversed host->reflector connection). Next thing is VNC
display number after a colon (or a port number, for reversed
connections), then follows plaintext host password after a space.

Sample to connect to some.hostname.com's display :0 (port 5900):

=== cut ===
some.hostname.com:0 PaS$w0rD
=== cut ===

Sample to listen for host connection on the port 5998:

=== cut ===
*:5998 PaS$w0rD
=== cut ===

Format of the PASSWD_FILE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

PASSWD_FILE keeps passwords for client connections.

It may contain two lines with one password on each line. First line is
for full-control client password, second line is for read-only client
password. Empty lines denote no authentication. If the file contains
one line, then there is no read-only password, and all clients would
have been granted full-control access.

Control signals
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  * SIGHUP signal causes VNC Reflector to disconnect all connected
    clients.

  * SIGUSR1 signal tells VNC Reflector that it should re-read
    HOST_INFO_FILE and to re-connect to host specified there
    preserving client connections. Note that in the current version,
    desktop geometry of all hosts should be the same.
